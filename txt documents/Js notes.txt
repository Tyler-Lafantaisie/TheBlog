To connect your Javascript, you will need to  us the <script></script> tags.
If you are only adding your Javascript via your HTML document, then you will add your Javascript between the <script></script> tags.
If your using a Javascript document then your going to add your link to the file in the first <script src../js/main.js></script> like that.
At the end of every line of code add a  semi colon ; this tells Javascript that your done instructing it what to do for now until the next instruction.
to add a on line comment do //.
to add a multi line comment do /* */.
Javascript is case sensitive so make sure your using the same casing that is required for Javascript to do what you ask of it propperly.
If you want to use more then one word in your variable the you have to camlecase ( the first word is undercase and the second word is uppercase).
Constant vareables need to be in upper case.
make sure you do proper spacing so others can read your work.
